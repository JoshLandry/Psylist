		<h1> Psytrance / Psyelectronik mixables list - (no time to review all these albums) </h1>
		<p>
5 - Gold - Creates a unique world with depth and possibilities.  Masterful / moving throughout <br>
4 - Great - Ear pleasing music, though a bit more monotonous/standard.  This shit is awesome! <br>
3 - Solid at points and enjoyable in small doses, but sloppy, silly, monotonous or lacking distinctive features.  I sometimes delete these, I often keep them for individual tracks. <br>
2 - Cheesy or full of bad samples, awkwardly produced, and boring.  I probably deleted it. <br>
1 - I deleted it.  It has no redeeming features. <br>

					<div>
						<p>
2015 Anattmann - Off the Grid EP [very clean and bright major key melodic hi tech w/ philosophical sampling] <br>
2015 Ben Rama - Rooftop Hopping EP [2 highly developed emotional techno tracks by Rama, remixes by Flembaz and Trilingo are less interesting] <br>
2015 Chris Rich - Pyrite Music EP [subtle euphoric twilight/daytime full power, nice lead sounds, but could use more distinctive character] <br>
2015 Conspirated - Magic Trigger EP [intensely trippy and warped forest darkpsy and darkprog which is somewhat sloppy, w/ too many tempo and voice-chopping effects, but has a profoundly strange attitude and structure.  10' darkpsy closer at 155bpm is best track] <br>
2015 Drip Drop & Yann - Rollercoaster EP [well produced twilight full on which sometimes feels formulaic/too skeletal, other times has amazing groove and feeling] <br>
2015 Ender - Emergence EP [somewhat sloppily produced but very emotional bass music along the lines of Koan or Solar Fields, one amazing purplestep tune] <br>
2015 Ender & MorBeat - Keys to the Eschaton EP [divine emotional prog for the 1st tracks, liquid DNB for 2nd two, with great synths but weak/simple beats; they should've done 4 tracks of trance] <br>
2015 Ethosphere - Existence [technically perfect/virtuosic guitar infused downtempo w/ cinematic scope, moves thru many sections w/ moog leads and riffs.  melody ideas often feel too academic/vanilla] <br>
2015 Kramavich - Bop Trance EP [smoothly produced/mastered, compositionally simplistic melodic day full on that is light and clean, inspired by prog and mainstream Ibiza sound, pleasant but safe] <br>
2015 Manik Buluk - Dimension of Damnation [ferociously trippy psycore w/ great weird synths and structures, mastering is muddy and sampling can be sloppy] <br>
2015 Millivolt - Diplodocus EP [initially unmemorable but satisfyingly deep and complex amelodic psygressive] <br>
2015 MoOka - Requiem [throbbing forest darkpsy bangers, great powerful kinetic energy but certainly monotonous] <br>
2015 Nayan - The Keyboard Warrior EP [twilight full on w/ intrusive silly samples / chaotic feel, but very well produced and arranged hypnotic synth/bass] <br>
2015 Nocturnal - Tunnel Vision EP [longform morning progressive with too many repeated samples and underuse of melody, but very solid sound and underlying detail] <br>
2015 Nutram Kalku - Ancestral Vortex [ambitious primal tribal darkpsy w/ great mastering, not as convincing as Dark Whisper or Xikwri Neyrra] <br>
2015 Open Tribe - Between the Kicks EP [well produced day full on w/ somewhat silly sampling and unfocused/skeletal character, Prodigy "Breathe" riff for example is inexplicably re-used throughout a song] <br>
2015 Pettra - Middle Eastern EP [pleasantly spacious Israeli full on with slightly canned traditional instrument sampling and exotic themes] <br>
2015 Penumbra - Dancefloors and Broomsticks EP [very nicely produced melodic full on w/ silly attitude, sometimes takes the uninteresting compositional route] <br>
2015 RomeodarK - Infected Nation [freeform forest darkpsy and psycore, very original 'jump-cut' type rhythmic and structure ideas, but production can be harsh/cluttered, effects sometimes heavy handed] <br>
2015 Quantum Universe - Inside the Mind of a Psychedelic Cat EP [melodic goa / acid-psy w/ nice lead arp textures, well conceived, but production too simple / basic and music can be boring to focus on] <br>
2015 Saikro - Human Transmutation EP [richly creative and well produced twilight full on made unplayable by too many samples in some cases] <br>
2015 Sound Strider - Escape Magic EP [bizarre, roughly produced and glitched out techno, house and psy inspired experimental 4/4 with interesting hopeful melodies and attitude] <br>
						</p>
						<p>
2015 VA [Absolut Shit] - Absolut Shit EP1 [experimental dark forestpsy, two incredible tunes from Mubali and Walpurgisnacht, other two are less coherent] <br>
2015 VA [Melting Runes Records] - Monsters Under My Bed [high quality psygressive echo chamber bangers from AjmaGard, Diffus, Green Child. Entire comp is nearly ruined by distasteful monster/killer theme and sampling] <br>

2014 Hallulaya - Flower Powder EP [psygressive w/ organic plant undertone & melody] <br>
2014 Hypogeo - Remixed Trips to Ixtlan [very dark and throbbing tribal psygressive remixes, some better than others] <br>

2014 Kabayun - Hot Coffee EP [well produced but indistinct night full on] <br>
2014 K Man - Electro Magnetic Destroyer [12"] [direct hypnotic wobbly old school style dubstep] <br>
2014 Krosis - Profane Geometry EP [technically flawless night full on with hi tech style sounds, a bit indistinct until very melodic final track] <br>
2014 Mellow Sonic - Dreamcatcher [epic, ambitious, sometimes overlong or flatly produced ambient & DNB along the lines of Cybernetika] <br>
2014 Metta - In Love [scattered, bright & upbeat 3rd act from Mettanoia, many nice goa-esque and morning trance melodies, but many obnoxious sing-song samples and lack of structure] <br>
2014 Neonglo - Rythmic Doses [ADD kid hi tech w/ nice arpy melodies but overly dry/monotonous sound, too many cartoonish samples] <br>
2014 NuTone - Dare to Dream EP [clean and subtley produced prog full on, some weak samples] <br>

2014 Raaya - Magnetic Bots EP [somewhat awkwardly produced digital goa influenced psy at 150bpm.  very interesting ideas, lead sounds need work] <br>

				<h5>2015</h5>
					<div>
						<p>
2015 Cerbura - Ears Can't Lie EP [well mastered darkpsy w/ some good noisy lead textures, but also overly naked cheesy melodic leads, some very bad sampling as well.  too cheesy to spin] <br>
2015 Ectogasmics & Nobot - Ectobot EP [well mastered and produced forest darkpsy w/ good bass sounds and groove, but a lack of diversity in sound palette, unfocused/half-assed goofy vibe, unmemorable character, annoying sampling of kids, one of the weaker Parvati releases] <br>
2015 Dunkelheits - About Magic EP [overly shrill, structurally predictable dissonant Timecode style twilight psy, leads have nice 'driven crazy' feeling, but basslines can be unimaginative, mastering is 2D/murky] <br>
2015 Fuzulu - Morphic Resonance EP [well produced dark forestpsy suffers from cheesy samples, lack of content and two similar versions of one tune within 4 songs total] <br>
2015 Gaddy - Sleeping With An Ashtray EP [skillfully produced wannabe funky glitch hop / psydub, cheesy attitude and groove despite some good rhodes work and melody] <br>
2015 Gurgamesh - Droplets of the Divine EP [ambient forest psycore, murky production has not improved since previous EPs, lots of clutter, nice vibe but no really memorable songs] <br>
2015 Kokobloko & Radice - Brainboard [dense and thick but unmemorable and familiar feeling darkpsy around 165 bpm.  mastering is muddy / not ear pleasing, album grows quite monotonous even if it does have compositional details throughout] <br>
2015 Limiti - Information is Creation [claustrophobic full on w/ too many unpleasant ring mod sounds, and overcompressed mastering.  ambitious ideas and compositions, some good moments] <br>
2015 Open Source - Ego Killer [big sounding but cheesy/simple stadium prog, most songs have annoying samples, a couple great more sophisticated tunes near the end] <br>
2015 Uttara - Psychedelic Behavior EP [prog full on with trebley mastering and cheesy sampling / breakdowns.  decent ideas/compositions, but sounds could be more pleasing to the ear and unique] <br>
2015 Wolf-E-Wolf - Purple Planet [oversimple/underdeveloped purple step that has good melodies and overall punch but monophonic sound, lack of detail] <br>
						</p>
						<p>
2015 VA [Dark Mind Records; Neurotrance Records] - Surreal Mutation [hard, dissonant Timecode style twilight psy, good freaky lazer leads and high quality mastering, but overall very formulaic/monotonous, starts to sound shallow quickly] <br>
2015 VA [Dred Collective] - Dred Collective Vol. 3 [huge 48 track collection of simplistic old school styled hardcore and jungle, lots of throwaway tunes, clearly digital despite old school theme, production is cheap/dull.  definitely some badass successful jungle and trap drops, as well.  label should have stuck to shorter length of previous VAs] <br>
						</p>
					</div>
				<h5>2014</h5>
					<div>
						<p>
2014 Aghori Tantrik - Patala (the Underworld) [expressive but very sloppy and lo-fi tribal psycore, audible clipping and bad compression which was not present on his previous albums, track quality is uneven / unmastered] <br>
2014 Alrune - Myths 'n' Legends [flimsy and cheesy suomi, only a couple real ideas of note, makes up for lack of substance w/ silly mischievious vibe, like barely restrained laughter] <br>

2014 Arronax - Crossing the Rubicon [neogoa with production that is harsh to the ear, too much use of bad distortion plugins, compositions are solid but some feel too basic or familiar] <br>
2014 Astro Raph - Eternal Spirit EP [overly plain electrosoul / trap / bass, chill mood] <br>
2014 Blind-Ox - The Heliacal Rising of Sirius [a valiant attempt at 190bpm forest/hi tech, claustophobic in the end and oversampling of Tool and soundtracks is annoying.  psy parts are generally quality, but tracks could be more eventful for their speed and length.  mastering powerful but hard on the ears / not the clearest] <br>
2014 Civilian Sol - When Tomorrow Comes [cheesy electro soul with annoying loud wobbles and pitched up vocal samples, good melodies and compositions at times but overall production is artificially crackly and "analog", actually very digital] <br>
2014 Code Therapy - Keep Running EP [clean & bland progressive techno, not one of the stronger Digital Diamonds releases] <br>
2014 Conendrum - Extreme Track Makeover [freeform forestpsy sample splice remixes, nice bouncy basslines but too many stops and incongruous sounds] <br>
2014 Crennwiick - First Reflexion EP [Crennwiick's production sounds limited and flat w/ unsatisfying cardboardy kicks and too few layers of chirpy arp melodies, however his 2nd song "Other Eyes" has a nice pad melody and the Code Therapy remix is quite good] <br>
2014 Flowjob - Eat Peyote EP [pretty & well produced but cheesy / formulaic psyprog] <br>
2014 Infra - Wormholes and Cake EP [unfocused and cheesy but well produced psycore, too discontinuous] <br>

2014 Juicy Bits - Moon Sine [funky prog house & techno with too much artifical rasta flavor] <br>
2014 Lectro Spektral Daze - Out Of Body Experience EP [full on with muddy production marketed as goa, some nice lead sounds] <br>
2014 Lunar Tourist - Mind Trip EP [retro melodic progressive trance, not psy.  very basic sounds and production but good emotion] <br>
2014 Menterama - Meno Impatto Sull'Ambiente Pie Impato Sul Futuro [zany hi tech/psycore w/ tastelessly limited mono mastering that pumps strangely whenever the bass is removed, sometimes meandering or cluttered compositions w/ lots of obnoxious cartoon sample cut-ups.  Some lead/bass combinations are powerful/trippy, a couple songs are good high powered psychedelic, production style and quality is uneven as if album is an anthology] <br>
2014 Moment - Your Wish Is My Command EP [nice sounding but unmemorable / cheesy prog full on, annoying science documentary samples] <br>
2014 Neelix & Phaxe - Angels Of Destruction EP [well produced electro-prog, 1st track has annoying pitch stretched vox, 2nd track is dope but stupid samples] <br>
2014 Ovnimoon & Rigel - Omnipresent Technology [goa influenced prog full on with unpleasantly EQ'd mastering.  bassline masks some nice compositional ideas, but melody sounds are boring] <br>
2014 Penumbra - The Journey EP [somewhat simplistic twilight full on w/ nice overall sound but some songs that drag or fail to evoke] <br>
2014 Psilocybian - Unfold Oneself Into Endlessness [downtempo album by full on producer, very nice arp melodies but otherwise rigid or formulaic feeling songs, certainly better at full power] <br>
2014 Psychoz vs. Dark River - The Outsiders [sloppy metal inspired darkpsy w/ awful sounding sampling, sloppy production and skeletal songs, but cool necro lo-fi feel] <br>
2014 Psymbionic - Parallels (Part 1- Storm) EP [cheesy at times purplestep w/ great sounds and production but weak rappers, Vibesquad remix steals show] <br>
2014 Scatterbrain - Return to Dust EP [creative and emotional return, unfortunately he clearly does not have his old gear, and obvious built in Ableton FX are used, making tracks unpleasant on the ears and not spinnable] <br>
2014 Somnium - Rocket Science EP [complex but indistinct/scatterbrained twilight-ish full on w/ solid basslines, occasional simple/cheesy melodies, decent textures and accent sounds but cluttery production and lack of substance.  track called "The Sequence" has a lead melody far too close to Daft Punk] <br>
2014 Sound Control - Electrocution Dub / Salute the Rockers [12"] [unconvincingly rastafarian dub / dubstep, nice bass sounds but too simple] <br>
2014 Stereographic - Visible Sounds [well produced twilight full on, sometimes awkward / not especially distinct, cheesy attitude and samples] <br>
2014 Terapeutica - Chromatic Planet [gentle uplifting, pleasantly layered day full on, formulaic and lacking stand out elements/leads, never distinguishes itself significantly, but not cheesy/lame] <br>
2014 Upavas - Extreme Frequencies EP [rounded minimal full on bangers, nice vibe but sounds seem lost in murk, only 1 memorable tune of 4] <br>
						</p>

2014 VA [Glitchy.Tonic Records] - Catharsis [psygressive, two amazing tunes from Jekyll and Psylophonica, several others with decent grooves ruined by annoying samples, or indistinctly minimal] <br>
2014 VA [Gravitas Recordings] - DEF CON 22- The Official Soundtrack [hit and miss collection of nerdy electronic of all genres, prominently poppy/bright & ravey dubstep, glitch hop, hip hop and electro.  many of the best tracks are hip hop] <br>
2014 VA [Horrordelic] - Mysteries of Death [ginormous 52 song (6 hour) horror themed darkpsy comp, mastering is good, some solid mischievious tracks, but easily as many cheesy ones with obnoxious scream samples] <br>

2014 VA [Melting Runes Records] - Mind Expander [decent throbbing psygressive with angsty attitude and many silly samples.  a couple amazing tracks by The Greys and Protox, most tunes don't rank among the artists' best, such as with Moses, Filt and AjmaGard] <br>
2014 VA [Psymoon Records] - Satori Festival Vol. 1 [hit and miss darkpsy that feels at times pointless or claustrophobic, great psychedelic gems from Mysteria Opus, Eniko vs Kimeros] <br>

						<p>
2013 AzTek - Beer Not Just A Breakfast Drink EP [overly basic, though funky proggy beats + bass] <br>
2013 Au5 - Singularity [single] [ravey / cheesy huge melodic tear out with club trance breakdowns, incredible wobbles nearly make up for some predictable melodic lameness] <br>
2013 Coredyceps - Sonic Meditation EP [spirited but sloppy and scatterbrained gabber influenced psycore, philosophy comes with McKenna samples, relied upon too heavily] <br>
2013 Cosmogonia - The Ritual [lengthy atmospheric forestpsy tracks with rough production and little flow] <br>
2013 Druid Cloak - Athene's Hollow EP [melodic future garage, some annoying sample repetition but great dusty jazz vibe in a couple songs, quality remixes] <br>

2013 Flicker Light - Shamanic Journey [somewhat skeletal psygressive w/ silly overuse of samples about drugs] <br>

2013 Infinity - Control Group [competent emotional progressive w/ terrible sampling & themes] <br>

2013 Outstanding Nerd - Global Technology [solid 160 BPM darkpsy / hi tech w/ some dry/uninteresting glitchy lead sounds and general monotonous, zoned out feeling.  initial collab tracks are most vibrant] <br>

2010 VA [Mitnal Records] - Dopamin Hypothesis [unmastered feeling 3 hour hard & high speed darkpsy comp w/ some great tracks and some stupid/sloppy ones that clearly should have been left off.  Worth it for Stitch, Aghori Tantrik, Zero Blade, etc.] <br>

						</p>
						<p>
2009 VA [Helicon Sound System Records] - Helicon Vedas [very hard, often claustrophobic darkpsy, good songs by Access Gremlin and Fractal Error, overall album is indistinct/fatiguing w/ loud/harsh mastering job] <br>

						</p>
						<p>
2005 VA [QQS Distribution] - Psychedelic Travelers [often simplistic and meatheaded stadium full on w/ GMS, Talamasca, Astrix and other huge names.  most songs (Absolum, Infected Mushroom) are not exclusive, fresh sounding songs from S.U.N. Project and Shiva Skazi save it] <br>
						</p>

						<p>
2004 Dom & Roland - Chronology [solid harder than hard dissonant techstep DNB, unfortunately the most distorted/compressed mastering possible] <br>

				<h5>1999</h5>
					<div>
						<p>
1999 Darshan - Spectra [bizarre, sloppy and meandering minimal psy, chillout and techno.  Elements do not fit together, momentum dissipates frustratingly, and the music seems indecisively stuck between actual trance and downtempo.  There are a few amazing and emotional synth lines, but they have little context.  very druggy/spaced album]<br>
1999 Space Tribe - 2000 O.D. [stripped down goa with less melody, intelligence and power than previous albums.  sarcastic samples clearly detract]<br>

				<h5>2015</h5>
					<div>
						<p>
2015 Different Shapes - Different Colors [sappy, sequenced feeling new agey melodic ambient w/ preset 80's pad sounds and basic production, cliched and inferior to similar classics] <br>
2015 Vlastur - Parvati In Dub EP [ear pleasing but cluttered and pointless psydub remixes of forest darkpsy by Jahbo et al, darkpsy ambience is gutted and circles in the background, competing for space with original dub elements.  an experiment that turned out to be a bad idea] <br>

				<h5>2014</h5>
					<div>

2014 AMB - Going Down EP [awkward/forced attempt at bass music centered around scratchy old timey samples of piano and voice.  sloppily produced and poorly done melodies, annoying hipster vibe] <br>
2014 Dragon Tales - Only for the Wicked EP [well composed goa trance with the most terrible and harsh production I've ever heard.  leads are shrill and the rest of the music is barely audible] <br>
2014 Gantz - Spry Sinister / Rising [12"] [awkward dubstep with one unconvincing middle eastern track (badly produced grainy lead, and unblended chanting), and another aggressive wobbly tune that would be great if the beat was not glitched so much, making it unmixable] <br>
2014 Kettenkarussel - Easy Listening [skeletal, repetitive deep house w/ far too little happening for the attention span, obvious use of built in Ableton erosion and harmonizers] <br>
2014 Lux Moderna & Dubvirus - Opening the Pentagram [very long and minimal psychill flavored bass grooves featuring incessant and repetitive Indian chant of the most cliched kind.  would not mind this minimalism if not for extreme new age cheese] <br>
2014 Mr. Hades - Psychedelic Underworld EP [sloppy, obvious hi tech horrorpsy w/ amazingly tonedeaf melodies and preset lead sounds.  Some decent sounding moments outside of melodies and overused sampling] <br>
2014 Nibiru - Ayahuasca Dreams EP [murkily produced darkpsy with soupy freeform ambience that relies too heavily on samples of chanting, etc.  some very annoying samples of whiny voices, no real great tracks, some good ideas and basslines] <br>
2014 Round - Glass / Float [12"] [bland, stylish and forgettable deep house w/ pianos] <br>
2014 Wet Paint - Warm Nights EP [an attempt at funky breaks w/ vintage samples and glitch hop wobbles, very rough production is harsh on the ears, samples/attitude are irritating.  one of Adapted Rec's worst releases] <br>
						</p>
						<p>
2014 VA [AEI Music] - This is Dubstep [2xCD] [MIXED] [simplistic, often cheesy and anthemic 2 disk dubstep w/ too many vocals and RPG music preset string synths, a lot of big room pop EDM tunes w/ no actual dubstep aspects, only good songs are obvious/familiar singles like LAS and J:Kenzo's "Feel It". too annoying to listen straight thru, not much good new music to be found here] <br>
2014 VA [Permanent Vacation] - If This Is House I Want My Money Back Vol. 3 [bland, rigid deep house w/ transparent blocky structures, far too little going on, no terribly interesting textures] <br>
2014 VA [Sound Kitchen Records] - Beyond the Tuubi [flimsy digital suomi w/ lazy dry production, over-loud sampling and annoying novelty feel, Puoskari does not save it]
						</p>

2013 Club Kooma - Latino Guitars [overused Spanish guitar solo samples w/ overly basic bouncy suomi] <br>
2013 DataKult - Final Download [narrative melodic cyberpunk EBM influenced darkpsy, many overly thick and distorted leads make for unlistenable production in nearly every track, some good ideas & very original] <br>

2012 VA [Jellyfish Frequency Recordings] - Hypnotic Masquerade [patchy experimental forest darkpsy comp: Mubali, Parus and Fractal Cowboys deliver solid songs, but several artists contribute long, sloppy experimental tracks instead of darkpsy, such as Ghreg on Earth, Penta, Mugwort Moon, and there is an irritating circus theme] <br>
						</p>
